<b><i>Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning</i></b>
This repository contains a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor detection using medical imaging. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify MRI scans as tumor or non-tumor, providing an automated and efficient method for early diagnosis.

<b>features: </b>

I. Preprocessing of MRI images for enhanced model performance.

II. CNN-based architecture for accurate tumor classification

III. Implementation in TensorFlow

IV. Dataset handling and augmentation techniques

V. Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics

<b>Models:</b>

System is divided into 5 model.

I. Dataset: In dataset we can take multiple MRI images and take one as input image.

II. Pre-processing: In pre-processing image to encoded the label and resize the image.

III. Split the data: In split the data we set the image as Training Data and Testing Data.

IV. Build CNN model: To train Deep Neural network for classification.

V. Classification: Used to classify the Brain tumor.


<b>Usage:</b>

I. Install the required dependencies

II. Load the dataset and preprocess images

III. Train the deep learning model

Iv. Evaluate performance and visualize predictions
